Since I last posted here, about a week and a half ago, plenty has changed with the Gameboy game I've been working on. Multiple projectiles are now supported and they collide with and damage enemies. Also, the wall sprites my partner were finished and added to the game.

From here the plan is to support multiple enemies, make those enemies move and attack, and then support multiple rooms with random enemy spawns.
