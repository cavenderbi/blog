Advice for anyone taking this class in the future, make time to do your final paper. Right now, I'm trapped between a Capstone Project, a Graphics class with Parry that's been absolutely unrelenting, and a gen-ed class that's expecting bi-weekly essays on Greek and Roman Literature. I didn't even realize this class had a final until half way through the semester when Dr. Wilkes mentioned it in class one day. 

As for the top 3 things I learned in this class, I'd say it's these: 
1. This class reminded me of and expanded on what I knew about the whole Edward Snowden situation that happened a while back. 
2. I read my first privacy policy.
3. I learned way more about bees than you would expect for a class with a Computer Science designation.
