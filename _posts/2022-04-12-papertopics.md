There were a couple of final project topics that piqued my interest.

- I'm usually pretty wary of anything blockchain or crypto, but I'm interested to see what Lewis has to say, both in this class, and for his final presentation in Capstone. 
- Someone else was doing one similar to mine, where they were looking into the recent behaviors of game publishers and developers with loot boxes and other gambling-lite and fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) game mechanics.
