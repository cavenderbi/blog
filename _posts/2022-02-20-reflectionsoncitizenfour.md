While before our in-class viewing of the CitizenFour documentary I was aware of Edward Snowden and the information he had leaked from the US Government, this has brought it back into the forefront of my mind. I've always had a distrust of authority, especially government. I'm about as center-libertarian as it gets. In my opinion what Snowden did was entirely justified and he should be welcomed home as a hero to the American people. He selflessly sacrificed his normal life to inform the American populace as to the US governments and the ISPs intelligence operation. Will it happen? No. Will it ever stop? No. Nothing short of a full-on second Civil War would get this to stop, and who says that the survivors of such a conflict wouldn't do the same, or worse?
