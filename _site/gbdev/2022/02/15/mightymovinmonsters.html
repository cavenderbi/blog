                <p>Last week I finished making where the RogueLIGHT supported multiple enemies. It was pretty easy and very similar to how the projectiles worked. Not much to say about it, this week was pretty cut and dry.</p>

<p>I finished that Friday and started working on moving the camera. Iâ€™ve got a basic camera moving around in steps of 1 Gameboy screen, scrolling around a B/W pixel art I downloaded off the internet, and I now plan to implement that into the larger project.</p>

<p>So for next week expect a camera moving around a test scene of four interconnected rooms, and possibly basic random level generaton. Should I get all of that done, next on the list is more complex player/enemy interractions such as taking/dealing damage and pathfinding, as well as dealing with what happens when a player dies.</p>
