                <p>This is where I’ll possibly be writing about the process of developing a Gameboy game. I’ve already been at it for a few weeks now and it’s actually pretty fun. Anyways, so far I’ve got a sprite that moves around the screen and collides with the wall and shoots a single projectile.</p>

<p>The plan from here is to add support for multiple projectiles and killable enemies. My partner in crime is working on re-drawing the wall sprites and creating a few new rooms.</p>
