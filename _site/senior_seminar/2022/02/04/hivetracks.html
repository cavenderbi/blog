                <p>I don’t have much to say for this one. With the block-chain data ownership concept Prof. Wilkes mentioned in class Feb. 2<sup>nd</sup>, all of my ethical questions were answered. I only have one question remaining. Does Prof. Wilkes honey glaze his own hams with honey his bees made? Not an ethical question, but it sounds like it’d be amazing and I’m hungry.</p>
