                February 4th, 2022
                <p>During the first two weeks of class, or at least what was left of them after Snowmageddon, we had an in-class discussion on our personal ethics. Personally, I really liked the “Treat others how <em>they</em> would like to be treated.” play on the golden rule, and I think that encapsulates a lot of the generational conflict we see today. (Credit to whoever said that, I forgot your name. Sorry.)</p>

<p>Another observation I liked was that people are ‘greedier’ when it comes to big choices in life. I certainly agree. Something small like holding the door open for someone doesn’t hurt me in the slightest, but would cause some positive to someone else, so I do it. If I apply to my ‘dream job’, I get an interview and they tell me there’s another candidate, it would be nice of me to let them get the job; I’m not doing it because it would be a net negative to me to not get that job, even if there’s a positive.</p>
