    <p>Hello, world! This is the first thing I’ve ever made in HTML, but I want to learn and Client-Side wasn’t available this semester, so I’m taking this opportunity to teach myself. Do mind the ugly until I figure out what I’m doing.</p>

<p>Anyways, I’m Brandan Cavender and this is my new blog for CS-4100 (Senior Seminar), though I may be posting more than that in the future.</p>

<p>My best in-class computing experience would have to be in Programming Languages with the final project, I made a calculator purely in Haskell. That was a fun challenge. Hopefully my Capstone Project is even better. I’m writing a Gameboy game in C. I may post about that here too.</p>

<p>As for my best out-of-class computing experience, that would be a tough one. The time I changed the password on my Mom’s work computer when I was 5 is a highlight. Or the time when I was 5 and I almost ordered an RV online because I knew she wanted one. Or the literal weeks spent on Halo: Reach and Black Ops 2 playing with friends I still talk to today. It’s hard to pick just one.</p>
